A second opinion is valuable at multiple points in the cancer journey—after diagnosis, before major surgery, or when treatment plans aren’t well‑explained. Dr. Singhal highlights several scenarios in his article 

Unclear diagnosis or scans: Conflicting imaging or biopsy results can mask tumor location or spread.

Extensive or aggressive surgery recommendation: If radical surgery is suggested without discussing alternatives, a second perspective may reveal less invasive options.

No mention of neoadjuvant therapy: Some cancers benefit from chemotherapy or radiotherapy before surgery, which may reduce tumor size or complications.

Patient discomfort with current advice: Feeling rushed or not heard are legitimate reasons to seek another viewpoint.
Dr. Singhal’s process involves thorough imaging/pathology review, evidence‑based discussion, remote consultations, and unbiased guidance—sometimes confirming the original plan or offering alternate strategies. Within 1–2 days, patients get clarity, peace of mind, and empowered decision‑making.
